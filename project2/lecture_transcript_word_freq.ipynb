      "This one is kind of tricky. A -1. That's kind of tricky. There's a convention in Python that this \n",

      "this? Yeah?  \n",
      ">> STUDENT: (Away From Mic).  \n",
      ">> INSTRUCTOR: The last element for the list. It's funny that it's -1. This allows you to check \n",
      "your answer. This is very useful now. This function LIST takes what is given as an element \n",
      "and makes a list out of it. Again, the way to link this is the argument here is a string . The \n",
      "string containing ABCDE . This is one object. This string is only one object. There's one \n",
      "string. Okay? When you apply the function LIST to that one object, that function LIST \n",
      "transforms that object into a list of its components. ABCDE is six string of five characters . \n",
      "When you apply LIST to it, what this is going to do is it's going to create a list for you \n",
      "consisting of each of those elements . In this case, each of these characters. The subject is completely different -this object is completely different from the initial object. The initial \n",
      "object is one string. .  \n",
      "When You apply this function, now you have a list. With five objects. Which object is a \n",
      "character . This is very useful . Another very useful thing is that this list can be nested . Here \n",
      "you have this is a list has two commas here so this list has three elements. This is one \n",
      "element. This is another element . And this is another element. This list has three elements. \n",
      "But the single element is a list itself. Is not clear? This list contains 123 elements, and the \n",
      "single element, which is the first one you want to think, is a list by itself. Now you apply the \n",
      "length of the (Indiscernible) to this object . This will be answering you three. Why? Because \n",
      "this outermost list contains 123 objects.  \n",
      "So when you apply the length operator to this, if it's nested to the answer that you get is \n",
      "the outermost number of elements, so in this case three. Okay. Now when you have this \n",
      "nested list, the nice thing is you can index them by using double or triple indices that you \n",
      "want. Let's look at the example of double indices. Right here in this example, you have a list \n",
      ". This is the outermost brackets. That's a list. This list contains one element to two \n",
      "elements, three elements, four elements. The first element or the single element is a list \n",
      "that contains two elements. The first element contains -- excuse may the first list contains \n",
      "two elements. The first list contains two elements. So now you write down you assign this \n",
      "to the nested list and you write down two and one in brackets. This is telling you you access \n",
      "the -- what this means this two?  \n",
      "The Second element in this list, and when you get the second element of that list access the \n",
      "first element of that. What is the second element in the list? This is the first element \n",
      "because second element, third element. The second element is this list here and this list, \n",
      "that's the second one here. Now we are going to focus on that one and that one . You want \n",
      "element one so this is the single element for this and this is the first element of this and the \n",
      "answer is.[word?] Which is here. These are the four assistants for the classroom. Okay? A \n",
      "list is mutable. That means you can change the elements in the list. For example here, just \n",
      "to make sure that this is clear, this is a list assigned to the value A so the type of A list, now \n",
      "you want to use this A function to -- F function to print it in a precise and specified way. A \n",
      "and D parentheses DOA is the location of the subject and the value of that object . Now \n",
      "suppose now you access the single element of value A.  \n",
      "The single value is what you want and suppose you take the number five and you store it in \n",
      "that location. This is what this is doing for you. What this is doing is replacing this -- \n",
      "replacing this by five and now you do the same statement you will see that you get instead \n",
      "of 123 you would get 523. What are the elements here that you have to put together if \n",
      "you've never seen this? The elements here is you need to know what is the type of object \n",
      "you're dealing with . In this case it's a list. Because it's a list, you know that you can index \n",
      "the element of that list. That means you can access any element on that list . To access \n",
      "that, you use this mechanism of brackets of the index and at the time you can index \n",
      "whatever and you can change it or you can read it etc.  \n",
      "We have several caveats here. For example, you're looking at this particular example . A \n",
      "now is a type of string because this is on the right-hand side. This is string 123 assigned to A. You want to bring that ideal way which is the location for that and the value of that and \n",
      "then you would get the answer this is the idea and the value 123 but now it complains. I \n",
      "was accessing the single element and I was putting I wanted to store it in five. Here's the \n",
      "one I wanted to put five. I would not have it. So this is contradicting what I told you. I just \n",
      "told you that you have a list. I told you you can index the elements of a list. Here you have \n",
      "123. What is 1 to 3 on that first time it's not a list. You can make it a list and then index \n",
      "them.  \n",
      "The Idea here is you always have to be careful what is the type of object you are dealing \n",
      "with. A string is a string . That cannot be indexed. You want to index it, you can use the \n",
      "previous trick for transforming that into a list and now you can index that list so that's \n",
      "what's happening. Another important operation for these things is you want to add stuff to \n",
      "it. Depending on the collection and given operations to add stuff to your objects. So you \n",
      "have a list . You have a method . You have something like this in Python . That means \n",
      "whatever you write is a function that can be applied to that list . In this case you want to \n",
      "append to a list, and it has some brackets to pull the particular articles.  \n",
      "The Important thing to understand here is that the specification of this list, it tells you \n",
      "directly this will take here a single element . This is seeing you want to use this? The \n",
      "argument should be a single element. Let's try it out. 123 (Indiscernible) assigned to X. Now \n",
      "you say X (Indiscernible) but you want to append to this list X the element four so four will \n",
      "be added to this. All I'm saying is that this argument has to be a single element. So you \n",
      "printed and now four gets added to the list. There's something very nice . This part is nice \n",
      "in the language is that you can actually append an entire list to a list that you already have. \n",
      "Up to this point, X contains the list 1234.  \n",
      "Now I would like to append to this another list which is 45. So I would like to attach this to \n",
      "this . The trick is that this is saying this has to be a single element. So you say X dollar \n",
      "append parentheses four five, this is a single object. So this is okay . This is a single object. \n",
      "If you were going to ignore these brackets, this would not work because append will \n",
      "require here to have a single object but you put the brackets, that's a single object. Now \n",
      "notice what happens here. This 1234, you attached to it another object which is 45 as a \n",
      "single object. This is not going to be discreet increases or anything like that. So append is \n",
      "nice. There's something actually really useful in massive data mining which is this operation \n",
      "called extend . Extend is a more sophisticated type of append.  \n",
      "You want to extend a list by something, and in general, what this is telling you is that you \n",
      "can put here a single any interable type. You can put in a simple string here or you can put \n",
      "here a list or you can put here a tuple or a cell in the dictionary so this is very generic here \n",
      "as long as you put an argument that is one of these things that can be iterated . What this \n",
      "extend does this goes inside whatever you put here is an argument and takes this stuff \n",
      "inside and splits it out for you. Let's see the example here. You have a list 123 and you \n",
      "would like to extend that by this object here, which is 4567. Extend is different to append . \n",
      "Append comes in on one single object. Extend takes this cog goes inside cut takes every \n",
      "single piece and attaches it to the existing list here and this is the application of this. Moral \n",
      "of the story. Append and extend are related, but extend is a lot more sophisticated.  It Takes a complicated structure that you want to attach to something existing, and it goes \n",
      "inside of it and it breaks it down and creates this larger, nice object and you have to be \n",
      "careful where the errors are. Here another nice example. You have the same 123 and you \n",
      "want to extend it by the string ABC but you are using extend . This is going to go inside ABC \n",
      "and look at each individual component and it's going to attach it to this so you can create \n",
      "lists out of existing objects. That's the beauty and actually the power of this. Many times in \n",
      "data processing, you would like to delete an element, and you have a list to delete an \n",
      "element. You use this function called pop so you're going to pop something from the list.  \n",
      "You Specify the index of the element you would like to remove and remove it. When you \n",

      ">> INSTRUCTOR: The last element for the list. It's funny that it's -1. This allows you to check \n",
      "your answer. This is very useful now. This function LIST takes what is given as an element \n",
      "and makes a list out of it. Again, the way to link this is the argument here is a string . The \n",
      "string containing ABCDE . This is one object. This string is only one object. There's one \n",
      "string. Okay? When you apply the function LIST to that one object, that function LIST \n",
      "transforms that object into a list of its components. ABCDE is six string of five characters . \n",
      "When you apply LIST to it, what this is going to do is it's going to create a list for you \n",
      "consisting of each of those elements . In this case, each of these characters. The subject is completely different -this object is completely different from the initial object. The initial \n",
      "object is one string. .  \n",
      "When You apply this function, now you have a list. With five objects. Which object is a \n",
      "character . This is very useful . Another very useful thing is that this list can be nested . Here \n",
      "you have this is a list has two commas here so this list has three elements. This is one \n",
      "element. This is another element . And this is another element. This list has three elements. \n",
      "But the single element is a list itself. Is not clear? This list contains 123 elements, and the \n",
      "single element, which is the first one you want to think, is a list by itself. Now you apply the \n",
      "length of the to this object . This will be answering you three. Why? Because \n",
      "this outermost list contains 123 objects.  \n",
      "So when you apply the length operator to this, if it's nested to the answer that you get is \n",
      "the outermost number of elements, so in this case three. Okay. Now when you have this \n",
      "nested list, the nice thing is you can index them by using double or triple indices that you \n",
      "want. Let's look at the example of double indices. Right here in this example, you have a list \n",
      ". This is the outermost brackets. That's a list. This list contains one element to two \n",
      "elements, three elements, four elements. The first element or the single element is a list \n",
      "that contains two elements. The first element contains -- excuse may the first list contains \n",
      "two elements. The first list contains two elements. So now you write down you assign this \n",
      "to the nested list and you write down two and one in brackets. This is telling you you access \n",
      "the -- what this means this two?  \n",
      "The Second element in this list, and when you get the second element of that list access the \n",
      "first element of that. What is the second element in the list? This is the first element \n",
      "because second element, third element. The second element is this list here and this list, \n",
      "that's the second one here. Now we are going to focus on that one and that one . You want \n",
      "element one so this is the single element for this and this is the first element of this and the \n",
      "answer is.Which is here. These are the four assistants for the classroom. Okay? A \n",
      "list is mutable. That means you can change the elements in the list. For example here, just \n",
      "to make sure that this is clear, this is a list assigned to the value A so the type of A list, now \n",
      "you want to use this A function to -- F function to print it in a precise and specified way. A \n",
      "and D parentheses DOA is the location of the subject and the value of that object . Now \n",
      "suppose now you access the single element of value A.  \n",
      "The single value is what you want and suppose you take the number five and you store it in \n",
      "that location. This is what this is doing for you. What this is doing is replacing this -- \n",
      "replacing this by five and now you do the same statement you will see that you get instead \n",
      "of 123 you would get 523. What are the elements here that you have to put together if \n",
      "you've never seen this? The elements here is you need to know what is the type of object \n",
      "you're dealing with . In this case it's a list. Because it's a list, you know that you can index \n",
      "the element of that list. That means you can access any element on that list . To access \n",
      "that, you use this mechanism of brackets of the index and at the time you can index \n",
      "whatever and you can change it or you can read it etc.  \n",
      "We have several caveats here. For example, you're looking at this particular example . A \n",
      "now is a type of string because this is on the right-hand side. This is string 123 assigned to A. You want to bring that ideal way which is the location for that and the value of that and \n",
      "then you would get the answer this is the idea and the value 123 but now it complains. I \n",
      "was accessing the single element and I was putting I wanted to store it in five. Here's the \n",
      "one I wanted to put five. I would not have it. So this is contradicting what I told you. I just \n",
      "told you that you have a list. I told you you can index the elements of a list. Here you have \n",
      "123. What is 1 to 3 on that first time it's not a list. You can make it a list and then index \n",
      "them.  \n",
      "The Idea here is you always have to be careful what is the type of object you are dealing \n",
      "with. A string is a string . That cannot be indexed. You want to index it, you can use the \n",
      "previous trick for transforming that into a list and now you can index that list so that's \n",
      "what's happening. Another important operation for these things is you want to add stuff to \n",
      "it. Depending on the collection and given operations to add stuff to your objects. So you \n",
      "have a list . You have a method . You have something like this in Python . That means \n",
      "whatever you write is a function that can be applied to that list . In this case you want to \n",
      "append to a list, and it has some brackets to pull the particular articles.  \n",
      "The Important thing to understand here is that the specification of this list, it tells you \n",
      "directly this will take here a single element . This is seeing you want to use this? The \n",
      "argument should be a single element. Let's try it out. 123 assigned to X. Now \n",
      "you say X but you want to append to this list X the element four so four will \n",
      "be added to this. All I'm saying is that this argument has to be a single element. So you \n",
      "printed and now four gets added to the list. There's something very nice . This part is nice \n",
      "in the language is that you can actually append an entire list to a list that you already have. \n",
      "Up to this point, X contains the list 1234.  \n",
      "Now I would like to append to this another list which is 45. So I would like to attach this to \n",
      "this . The trick is that this is saying this has to be a single element. So you say X dollar \n",
      "append parentheses four five, this is a single object. So this is okay . This is a single object. \n",
      "If you were going to ignore these brackets, this would not work because append will \n",
      "require here to have a single object but you put the brackets, that's a single object. Now \n",
      "notice what happens here. This 1234, you attached to it another object which is 45 as a \n",
      "single object. This is not going to be discreet increases or anything like that. So append is \n",
      "nice. There's something actually really useful in massive data mining which is this operation \n",
      "called extend . Extend is a more sophisticated type of append.  \n",
      "You want to extend a list by something, and in general, what this is telling you is that you \n",
      "can put here a single any interable type. You can put in a simple string here or you can put \n",
      "here a list or you can put here a tuple or a cell in the dictionary so this is very generic here \n",
      "as long as you put an argument that is one of these things that can be iterated . What this \n",
      "extend does this goes inside whatever you put here is an argument and takes this stuff \n",
      "inside and splits it out for you. Let's see the example here. You have a list 123 and you \n",
      "would like to extend that by this object here, which is 4567. Extend is different to append . \n",
      "Append comes in on one single object. Extend takes this cog goes inside cut takes every \n",
      "single piece and attaches it to the existing list here and this is the application of this. Moral \n",
      "of the story. Append and extend are related, but extend is a lot more sophisticated.  It Takes a complicated structure that you want to attach to something existing, and it goes \n",
      "inside of it and it breaks it down and creates this larger, nice object and you have to be \n",
      "careful where the errors are. Here another nice example. You have the same 123 and you \n",

      "careful where the errors are. Here another nice example. You have the same 123 and you \n",
