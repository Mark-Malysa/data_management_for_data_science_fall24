      "This one is kind of tricky. A -1. That's kind of tricky. There's a convention in Python that this \n",

      "this? Yeah?  \n",
      ">> STUDENT: (Away From Mic).  \n",
      ">> INSTRUCTOR: The last element for the list. It's funny that it's -1. This allows you to check \n",
      "your answer. This is very useful now. This function LIST takes what is given as an element \n",
      "and makes a list out of it. Again, the way to link this is the argument here is a string . The \n",
      "string containing ABCDE . This is one object. This string is only one object. There's one \n",
      "string. Okay? When you apply the function LIST to that one object, that function LIST \n",
      "transforms that object into a list of its components. ABCDE is six string of five characters . \n",
      "When you apply LIST to it, what this is going to do is it's going to create a list for you \n",
      "consisting of each of those elements . In this case, each of these characters. The subject is completely different -this object is completely different from the initial object. The initial \n",
      "object is one string. .  \n",
      "When You apply this function, now you have a list. With five objects. Which object is a \n",
      "character . This is very useful . Another very useful thing is that this list can be nested . Here \n",
      "you have this is a list has two commas here so this list has three elements. This is one \n",
      "element. This is another element . And this is another element. This list has three elements. \n",
      "But the single element is a list itself. Is not clear? This list contains 123 elements, and the \n",
      "single element, which is the first one you want to think, is a list by itself. Now you apply the \n",
      "length of the (Indiscernible) to this object . This will be answering you three. Why? Because \n",
      "this outermost list contains 123 objects.  \n",
      "So when you apply the length operator to this, if it's nested to the answer that you get is \n",
      "the outermost number of elements, so in this case three. Okay. Now when you have this \n",
      "nested list, the nice thing is you can index them by using double or triple indices that you \n",
      "want. Let's look at the example of double indices. Right here in this example, you have a list \n",
      ". This is the outermost brackets. That's a list. This list contains one element to two \n",
      "elements, three elements, four elements. The first element or the single element is a list \n",
      "that contains two elements. The first element contains -- excuse may the first list contains \n",
      "two elements. The first list contains two elements. So now you write down you assign this \n",
      "to the nested list and you write down two and one in brackets. This is telling you you access \n",
      "the -- what this means this two?  \n",
      "The Second element in this list, and when you get the second element of that list access the \n",
      "first element of that. What is the second element in the list? This is the first element \n",
      "because second element, third element. The second element is this list here and this list, \n",
      "that's the second one here. Now we are going to focus on that one and that one . You want \n",
      "element one so this is the single element for this and this is the first element of this and the \n",
      "answer is.[word?] Which is here. These are the four assistants for the classroom. Okay? A \n",
      "list is mutable. That means you can change the elements in the list. For example here, just \n",
      "to make sure that this is clear, this is a list assigned to the value A so the type of A list, now \n",
      "you want to use this A function to -- F function to print it in a precise and specified way. A \n",
      "and D parentheses DOA is the location of the subject and the value of that object . Now \n",
      "suppose now you access the single element of value A.  \n",
      "The single value is what you want and suppose you take the number five and you store it in \n",
      "that location. This is what this is doing for you. What this is doing is replacing this -- \n",
      "replacing this by five and now you do the same statement you will see that you get instead \n",
      "of 123 you would get 523. What are the elements here that you have to put together if \n",
      "you've never seen this? The elements here is you need to know what is the type of object \n",
      "you're dealing with . In this case it's a list. Because it's a list, you know that you can index \n",
      "the element of that list. That means you can access any element on that list . To access \n",
      "that, you use this mechanism of brackets of the index and at the time you can index \n",
      "whatever and you can change it or you can read it etc.  \n",
      "We have several caveats here. For example, you're looking at this particular example . A \n",
      "now is a type of string because this is on the right-hand side. This is string 123 assigned to A. You want to bring that ideal way which is the location for that and the value of that and \n",
      "then you would get the answer this is the idea and the value 123 but now it complains. I \n",
      "was accessing the single element and I was putting I wanted to store it in five. Here's the \n",
      "one I wanted to put five. I would not have it. So this is contradicting what I told you. I just \n",
      "told you that you have a list. I told you you can index the elements of a list. Here you have \n",
      "123. What is 1 to 3 on that first time it's not a list. You can make it a list and then index \n",
      "them.  \n",
      "The Idea here is you always have to be careful what is the type of object you are dealing \n",
      "with. A string is a string . That cannot be indexed. You want to index it, you can use the \n",
      "previous trick for transforming that into a list and now you can index that list so that's \n",
      "what's happening. Another important operation for these things is you want to add stuff to \n",
      "it. Depending on the collection and given operations to add stuff to your objects. So you \n",
      "have a list . You have a method . You have something like this in Python . That means \n",
      "whatever you write is a function that can be applied to that list . In this case you want to \n",
      "append to a list, and it has some brackets to pull the particular articles.  \n",
      "The Important thing to understand here is that the specification of this list, it tells you \n",
      "directly this will take here a single element . This is seeing you want to use this? The \n",
      "argument should be a single element. Let's try it out. 123 (Indiscernible) assigned to X. Now \n",
      "you say X (Indiscernible) but you want to append to this list X the element four so four will \n",
      "be added to this. All I'm saying is that this argument has to be a single element. So you \n",
      "printed and now four gets added to the list. There's something very nice . This part is nice \n",
      "in the language is that you can actually append an entire list to a list that you already have. \n",
      "Up to this point, X contains the list 1234.  \n",
      "Now I would like to append to this another list which is 45. So I would like to attach this to \n",
      "this . The trick is that this is saying this has to be a single element. So you say X dollar \n",
      "append parentheses four five, this is a single object. So this is okay . This is a single object. \n",
      "If you were going to ignore these brackets, this would not work because append will \n",
      "require here to have a single object but you put the brackets, that's a single object. Now \n",
      "notice what happens here. This 1234, you attached to it another object which is 45 as a \n",
      "single object. This is not going to be discreet increases or anything like that. So append is \n",
      "nice. There's something actually really useful in massive data mining which is this operation \n",
      "called extend . Extend is a more sophisticated type of append.  \n",
      "You want to extend a list by something, and in general, what this is telling you is that you \n",
      "can put here a single any interable type. You can put in a simple string here or you can put \n",
      "here a list or you can put here a tuple or a cell in the dictionary so this is very generic here \n",
      "as long as you put an argument that is one of these things that can be iterated . What this \n",
      "extend does this goes inside whatever you put here is an argument and takes this stuff \n",
      "inside and splits it out for you. Let's see the example here. You have a list 123 and you \n",
      "would like to extend that by this object here, which is 4567. Extend is different to append . \n",
      "Append comes in on one single object. Extend takes this cog goes inside cut takes every \n",
      "single piece and attaches it to the existing list here and this is the application of this. Moral \n",
      "of the story. Append and extend are related, but extend is a lot more sophisticated.  It Takes a complicated structure that you want to attach to something existing, and it goes \n",
      "inside of it and it breaks it down and creates this larger, nice object and you have to be \n",
      "careful where the errors are. Here another nice example. You have the same 123 and you \n",
      "want to extend it by the string ABC but you are using extend . This is going to go inside ABC \n",
      "and look at each individual component and it's going to attach it to this so you can create \n",
      "lists out of existing objects. That's the beauty and actually the power of this. Many times in \n",
      "data processing, you would like to delete an element, and you have a list to delete an \n",
      "element. You use this function called pop so you're going to pop something from the list.  \n",
      "You Specify the index of the element you would like to remove and remove it. When you \n",

      ">> INSTRUCTOR: The last element for the list. It's funny that it's -1. This allows you to check \n",
      "your answer. This is very useful now. This function LIST takes what is given as an element \n",
      "and makes a list out of it. Again, the way to link this is the argument here is a string . The \n",
      "string containing ABCDE . This is one object. This string is only one object. There's one \n",
      "string. Okay? When you apply the function LIST to that one object, that function LIST \n",
      "transforms that object into a list of its components. ABCDE is six string of five characters . \n",
      "When you apply LIST to it, what this is going to do is it's going to create a list for you \n",
      "consisting of each of those elements . In this case, each of these characters. The subject is completely different -this object is completely different from the initial object. The initial \n",
      "object is one string. .  \n",
      "When You apply this function, now you have a list. With five objects. Which object is a \n",
      "character . This is very useful . Another very useful thing is that this list can be nested . Here \n",
      "you have this is a list has two commas here so this list has three elements. This is one \n",
      "element. This is another element . And this is another element. This list has three elements. \n",
      "But the single element is a list itself. Is not clear? This list contains 123 elements, and the \n",
      "single element, which is the first one you want to think, is a list by itself. Now you apply the \n",
      "length of the to this object . This will be answering you three. Why? Because \n",
      "this outermost list contains 123 objects.  \n",
      "So when you apply the length operator to this, if it's nested to the answer that you get is \n",
      "the outermost number of elements, so in this case three. Okay. Now when you have this \n",
      "nested list, the nice thing is you can index them by using double or triple indices that you \n",
      "want. Let's look at the example of double indices. Right here in this example, you have a list \n",
      ". This is the outermost brackets. That's a list. This list contains one element to two \n",
      "elements, three elements, four elements. The first element or the single element is a list \n",
      "that contains two elements. The first element contains -- excuse may the first list contains \n",
      "two elements. The first list contains two elements. So now you write down you assign this \n",
      "to the nested list and you write down two and one in brackets. This is telling you you access \n",
      "the -- what this means this two?  \n",
      "The Second element in this list, and when you get the second element of that list access the \n",
      "first element of that. What is the second element in the list? This is the first element \n",
      "because second element, third element. The second element is this list here and this list, \n",
      "that's the second one here. Now we are going to focus on that one and that one . You want \n",
      "element one so this is the single element for this and this is the first element of this and the \n",
      "answer is.Which is here. These are the four assistants for the classroom. Okay? A \n",
      "list is mutable. That means you can change the elements in the list. For example here, just \n",
      "to make sure that this is clear, this is a list assigned to the value A so the type of A list, now \n",
      "you want to use this A function to -- F function to print it in a precise and specified way. A \n",
      "and D parentheses DOA is the location of the subject and the value of that object . Now \n",
      "suppose now you access the single element of value A.  \n",
      "The single value is what you want and suppose you take the number five and you store it in \n",
      "that location. This is what this is doing for you. What this is doing is replacing this -- \n",
      "replacing this by five and now you do the same statement you will see that you get instead \n",
      "of 123 you would get 523. What are the elements here that you have to put together if \n",
      "you've never seen this? The elements here is you need to know what is the type of object \n",
      "you're dealing with . In this case it's a list. Because it's a list, you know that you can index \n",
      "the element of that list. That means you can access any element on that list . To access \n",
      "that, you use this mechanism of brackets of the index and at the time you can index \n",
      "whatever and you can change it or you can read it etc.  \n",
      "We have several caveats here. For example, you're looking at this particular example . A \n",
      "now is a type of string because this is on the right-hand side. This is string 123 assigned to A. You want to bring that ideal way which is the location for that and the value of that and \n",
      "then you would get the answer this is the idea and the value 123 but now it complains. I \n",
      "was accessing the single element and I was putting I wanted to store it in five. Here's the \n",
      "one I wanted to put five. I would not have it. So this is contradicting what I told you. I just \n",
      "told you that you have a list. I told you you can index the elements of a list. Here you have \n",
      "123. What is 1 to 3 on that first time it's not a list. You can make it a list and then index \n",
      "them.  \n",
      "The Idea here is you always have to be careful what is the type of object you are dealing \n",
      "with. A string is a string . That cannot be indexed. You want to index it, you can use the \n",
      "previous trick for transforming that into a list and now you can index that list so that's \n",
      "what's happening. Another important operation for these things is you want to add stuff to \n",
      "it. Depending on the collection and given operations to add stuff to your objects. So you \n",
      "have a list . You have a method . You have something like this in Python . That means \n",
      "whatever you write is a function that can be applied to that list . In this case you want to \n",
      "append to a list, and it has some brackets to pull the particular articles.  \n",
      "The Important thing to understand here is that the specification of this list, it tells you \n",
      "directly this will take here a single element . This is seeing you want to use this? The \n",
      "argument should be a single element. Let's try it out. 123 assigned to X. Now \n",
      "you say X but you want to append to this list X the element four so four will \n",
      "be added to this. All I'm saying is that this argument has to be a single element. So you \n",
      "printed and now four gets added to the list. There's something very nice . This part is nice \n",
      "in the language is that you can actually append an entire list to a list that you already have. \n",
      "Up to this point, X contains the list 1234.  \n",
      "Now I would like to append to this another list which is 45. So I would like to attach this to \n",
      "this . The trick is that this is saying this has to be a single element. So you say X dollar \n",
      "append parentheses four five, this is a single object. So this is okay . This is a single object. \n",
      "If you were going to ignore these brackets, this would not work because append will \n",
      "require here to have a single object but you put the brackets, that's a single object. Now \n",
      "notice what happens here. This 1234, you attached to it another object which is 45 as a \n",
      "single object. This is not going to be discreet increases or anything like that. So append is \n",
      "nice. There's something actually really useful in massive data mining which is this operation \n",
      "called extend . Extend is a more sophisticated type of append.  \n",
      "You want to extend a list by something, and in general, what this is telling you is that you \n",
      "can put here a single any interable type. You can put in a simple string here or you can put \n",
      "here a list or you can put here a tuple or a cell in the dictionary so this is very generic here \n",
      "as long as you put an argument that is one of these things that can be iterated . What this \n",
      "extend does this goes inside whatever you put here is an argument and takes this stuff \n",
      "inside and splits it out for you. Let's see the example here. You have a list 123 and you \n",
      "would like to extend that by this object here, which is 4567. Extend is different to append . \n",
      "Append comes in on one single object. Extend takes this cog goes inside cut takes every \n",
      "single piece and attaches it to the existing list here and this is the application of this. Moral \n",
      "of the story. Append and extend are related, but extend is a lot more sophisticated.  It Takes a complicated structure that you want to attach to something existing, and it goes \n",
      "inside of it and it breaks it down and creates this larger, nice object and you have to be \n",
      "careful where the errors are. Here another nice example. You have the same 123 and you \n",

      "And  \n",
      "pass it to a big program called a compiler. We translate the entire program at once. That  \n",
      "is why it is called a batch processing mode. Is that clear? The whole program at once has  to be passed to this compiler. Okay. An interpreter is quite different. An interpreter,  \n",

      "can install in your machine and we have the ability to take one instruction like that and  \n",

      "instruction gets translated by the Python interpreter into some machine code, the machine  \n",
      "code has to go into the CPU of your computer. It gets elevated and now has to be written  \n",
      "back. When it is written back that's the output you have here. It goes to the CPU and  \n",
      "comes back. Really? You do this? Go here, and go here. Not quite. This is very  \n",
      "important. For this to happen, the most recent place in your computer, your random \n",
      "access  \n",
      "memory of the computer. There should be a place where this information about the values \n",
      "or  \n",
      "variables in our program are installed. So think of that as a collection of boxes. That  \n",
      "is called the random access memory of your machine. In these boxes there is a box that \n",
      "the  \n",
      "interpreter knows corresponds to this variable name here, the letter a. Somehow the  \n",
      "interpreter now knows there is allocation that response to a. Here it says a equals 3.14.  \n",
      "That 3.14 is stored in that box and now when the CPU elevates has to get access to that \n",
      "and  \n",

      "instruction by an interpreter? Step one, the instruction gets translated. Into machine  \n",
      "code. Yeah? Step two, the computer, you don't see that. Elevates the instruction of the  \n",
      "CPU looks at. Step threeyou write the answers back to your screen. To be able to do that  \n",
      "the machine has to access those values into the random-access memory of the machine. \n",

      "be that the name contains he letters HAOYAG and if that's the case you want to write out \n",

      "apples? What kind of music? The number of parameters was something like 215. When you  \n",

      "data inside this? It is going to take his vector and it is going to take his vector and  \n",

      "stuff. Okay, so now you Python genius say that I'm going to generalize this to two  \n",
      "dimensions. And you can write code that has not very easily. It is the moral of the  \n",
      "story clear? The world is not two or three dimensions. The world of data. Okay. I  \n",

      "Different thresholds. They manipulate this depending on the number of users. It is very  \n",
      "simple. If something is less than $50 you pay a fee. These thresholds are somewhere  between 50 and a thousand. Now the fee is different. Something more than 1000 is a  \n",

      "popular on universities. Making good money by selling different stuff. These records,  \n",
      "whatever. You know better than I do. Bottom line is companies like this have certain  \n",

      "not, the fee is.02. But for every dollar you are going to pay, this to sense in this  \n",

      "the information. The important part is not the numbers. The important part is to  \n",
      "understand that there is a collection of categories. That describes the fee structure  \n",
      "you are paying. So how will you write something that will compute in the same way.  \n",
      "Going to 50 and you can do your computation. The fee you have to pay - - if this is not  \n",
      "the case then you have these instructions. And in that case it becomes different but I  \n",
      "hope you understand you have to pay a fee. For the first 50 items you apply this fee.  \n",
      "For the other items you apply the other fee. If this is not the case then you have the  \n",
      "other possibility. It is not that computing this mathematic is anything incredible and  \n",
      "fantastic. The point of this exercise is for any structure you can develop basically the  \n",
      "same kind of code. It means you have a collection of statements. If this is the case,  \n",
      "do this computation. If not, don't do this computation. If that is not the case, if  \n",
      "that is not the case, etc. That is the point of this exercise. To learn more coding  \n",
      "patterns rather than specific pieces of code. You can check the details. Okay. Another  \n",
      "point in the material is functions are objects. A function is an object. What the heck  \n",
      "that makes? Let's make it simple. It is an integer an object? Yes, sir no? Is a plot  \n",
      "and object? Is a - - value and object? These are the most atomic objects. Others are  \n",
      "more complicated. Not atomic. They are collections. Give me an example. Of an object  \n",
      "of - - a string. A string is an object. These are also objects. lists. Something  \n",
      "different to list is also an object. Dictionaries. Something different all of those  \n",
      "objects. What? Give me something different to all of this. Sets. You want to be a  \n",
      "programmer. This is the most elementary thing you should have. They are atomic objects  \n",
      "in any language. You can put them into collections to understand what are those  \n",
      "collections. What are the collections we have seen? Who can tell me that? Atomic  \n",
      "objects, integers. Jobs, bullets. Next is strings. Next? Come on guys, wake up. Wake  \n",
      "up. Lists. This one? Sets. Don't forget sets. We are missing something very  \n",
      "important. Not sets, not doubles, not sequences. Very powerful for expiration. What is  \n",
      "that? Dictionaries. It is important to have that very clearly in your head.  \n",
      "Dictionaries are not lists or sequences. Dictionaries are mappings. Books to order.  \n",
      "Students, blah blah blah. So when you have a function the function has its parameters.  \n",
      "Objects passed to that function. And a function produces objects as results. But now  \n",
      "this is saying something higher-level. It is a higher level of abstraction. Functions,  \n",
      "produce objects. Something higher-level. If the functions themselves are objects. It  \n",
      "was not in the list, first it was atomic, no collections, no dictionaries, sets. Now  something higher-level. Functions. Functions are also objects. This is hard to  \n",
      "swallow. I remember the first time I saw this. What defines an object? Can you tell us  \n",
      "what defines an object? You're not a politician. That's what you are. Yeah. To be an  \n",
      "object you have to have a value. What else? Right. What else? An identity. What are  \n",
      "the types? What is the value? It depends. What is the identity. In memory, it is not  \n",
      "usual on this time for you but this is what defines an object. Now type. Think of  \n",
      "integers as a good example of floats. I understand the value or this. And identity. A  \n",
      "location. That objects. Think of atomic objects as something similar to understand this  \n",
      "concept. But now for the function, what the heck is a value of a function? It's an  \n",
      "object. This is very. Maybe this is the most advanced concept. Until now we are using  \n",
      "it in this class. It is a concept. You don't have to dig into it. But the function to  \n",
      "exist. Must have some code that executes the function. If you have a function name, you  \n",
      "have that piece of code. Yes that is a quote of Python. The function you want to  \n",
      "execute. That's not. The value and the problem in a language sense of that function.  \n",
      "This is why makeup, when you write these pieces of code that say in Python in any  \n",
      "language it's like makeup. It is a makeup. It is on the surface. For that function to  \n",

      "That is going to simulate these instructions. That lower level in the computer, machine  \n",
      "or assembly language. What is the point we are trying to make? The point is when you  \n",
      "write this functions, in Python. The function depends on the low-level code. That  \n",
      "implements that function in the machine. And that low-level code is called bytes code.  \n",
      "That is the value of a function. Do you need to compute that? No. But it is good to be  \n",
      "aware of that. There is a translation process. When you write the Python code to  \n",
      "something, for example, for the very simple piece of code. This is the parameter X +1,  \n",
      "this is a very simple piece of code. You go and look at the machine code that simulates  \n",
      "this. It looks something like this. This, something like that. You need to understand  \n",
      "this? No. When you to computer architecture you may like this but the point is the  \n",
      "value of the function is determining when the interpreter reads the function you are  \n",
      "defining and translates that into machine code. And that machine code is really the one  \n",
      "doing the work. That is when the function exists. That is the bite code of the  \n",
      "function. It is important to be aware of that. Execution by the interpreter,  \n",
      "understanding immediately, they are executed, etc. So why all of this? Why all of this?  \n",
      "Because the fact that functions are objects. That means you can pass a function as a  \n",
      "parameter. Two other functions. Functions, other objects. The function now can be  \n",
      "functions as parameters. And that is what makes the language is extremely powerful.  \n",
      "Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions. For example you have a  \n",
      "function called print phase, that Prince some kind of face looking symbol. Something  \n",
      "like this. You type this in Python and say print phase. You will see two dots. This  \n",
      "and less. That is called a phase. A piece of code that is simple like that. Now, don't  \n",
      "take this lightly. Here this statement is taking this object that is a function and is  \n",
      "assigning that object to a variable that is named F UC, this variable is dysfunction  \n",
      "also, that assignment. You involve that function and get this result. Let me ask a  question before we go there because I want to make sure that you define this function.  \n",
      "This is not function. Now you take that function, assign it to another function and  \n",
      "invoke that new function. What is the output? What is the output? What is the output,  \n",
      "though? Can anybody tell me the output? He said a face. No, wrong. Two faces.  \n",
      "Explain why. To face.  \n",
      ">> STUDENT: [Away from mic] So you have two of the same functions.  \n",
      ">> PROFESSOR: Excellent. What's your name? Very good. Very good. This is two faces.  \n",
      "This will print that. Now you assign it out to another and invoke the other one that  \n",
      "happens to be the same thing so you get to faces. Suppose you have, functions being  \n",
      "arguments to other functions. Suppose you have a function, you printed this statement  \n",
      "and it would look like a human head, maybe. Or you have some other kind of statements  \n",
      "that create a monkey head. Something that looks like that. You print that and it gives  \n",
      "you a monkey head. Now you have two things. Human head and monkey head. And now \n",
      "you  \n",
      "have something that is print, another thing with parameter face. So this one is going to  \n",
      "give you something like the body. This is just functions. And you put them together.  \n",
      "Now you have two use it. Input, enter the one monkey, enter two, you want to do human.  \n",
      "If the choice is one you involve the one that is going to print the monkey head. If it's  \n",
      "too, you have the other one. You get something like that. What is the point? This,  \n",
      "what is that? It's a function. Being past. As a parameter. To a Function. Okay.  \n",
      "Also with functions, people love to do copy and paste. What is the problem with copy and  \n",
      "paste? I'm not saying don't do copy and paste. I find it very useful. When you are  \n",
      "developing code and have developed a piece of code you can copy and paste the code  \n",
      "somewhere else. What is it you have to be careful with? You have to be careful when you  \n",
      "do copy and paste that the return values of the function are not messed up. For example  \n",
      "here you have something, Fahrenheit. By the way, always, always, always, always, always.  \n",
      "When you define functions, have a value. It will make you write a lot nicer, don't  \n",
      "forget. For example you may have something here Fahrenheit., Here you have the code  \n",
      "something else and then here you have Fahrenheit. There is nothing wrong with this code,  \n",
      "nothing wrong. The problem is you copy and paste in this other statement that you have  \n",
      "copy and pasted is there so this is going to return something strange. So be careful  \n",
      "with what you do. Copy and paste. Another common errors is to determine the wrong  \n",
      "variable. Be careful with that. Another common error is not to determine the function,  \n",
      "always the value from the function. It's a lot more pressing. To finish this, today I  \n",
      "would like to make sure you understand the notion of scope. Very important in program  \n",
      "languages. The notion of scope of a variable. The scope or function. Let's focus on  \n",

      "And if it is outside a piece of your code, I'm going to give you an example. That is a  \n",

      "we are finishing up section 6. Then how to manipulate lists.  Then we will start with dictionary \n",
      "manipulation.  These topics are fundamental.  Last time, last part of lecture six.  We began \n",
      "discussing the scope.  For example, look at the definition of this function.  Look at the body of the \n",

      "function you have defined variables outside of a function called a global function.  The way to \n",
      "understand this is the variable is seen in the code.  Locally, and this is the case, total inches, or if it \n",
      "is to find out side of the function it may appear outside.  Also here, so it is not local, this is a global \n",
      "variable.  Now, you have something like this.  You notice here the name appears in the function.  \n",

      "happened?  You want to change the variable and you want to tell the interpreter this variable is a \n",
      "global variable.  Then what you do is - - the name of the variable with this Python.  The SSL key is \n",

      "The second type of manipulation.  You have some list and you are interested in the elements in that \n",

      "AUDIO) so, those are things that you need to do to create one of these blueprints and the \n",
      "first thing you need to do is need to define it and a way to define is very simple. So, here \n",
      "you use the keyword CLAS for class and you specify the name, whatever you want. \n",
      "Whatever name you want. And now you are going to initialize that here. Remember, you \n",
      "are finding a map for data. This is what this is doing. Oh, now the tricky thing that you need \n",
      "to be aware of is that there is a special method called INIT that stands for initialization and \n",
      "there is a under score and this method is very important. Anytime you have a name that \n",
      "has a_before and a_after, these are very special methods and they are called (NAME) \n",
      "methods and we will learn more about this throughout the semester and so what is this \n",
      "doing here? Well, this is initializing a class called time and Python uses this special \n",
      "parameter SCLF (SP?) and you can use whatever you want, but you know when I say class \n",
      "time I'm going to initialize myself. This is what this is.  \n",
      "Now, the way to think about this is that this is a collection of variables and this flexion of \n",
      "variables have values. So, with this particular thing is saying is this CLAS I am defining call \n",
      "time is going to have at this -- is going to have two variables and there could be a point of \n",
      "confusion here which is what is the name for the class? Is it time or is it self? The name for \n",
      "the class? It is time. The name is what you were defining about, it is time. So, this business \n",
      "of self is a trick and it is a trick and Python. It is a very powerful truck and it is saying we're \n",
      "going to initialize this graph and this very powerful treatment and remember these can be \n",
      "very complicated in general! And this is what allows Python to compare different very \n",
      "complicated object, because the objects are not going to be compared little by little, no, this will object has a string and Python deals with this when it is going to compare.  \n",
      "That is the magic of it. Okay, so this is just a name, it is a instance for the class time at this \n",
      "point with two variables, one called hours and one called minutes. Time has been initialized \n",
      "by SELF. Okay, now there is terminology associated with this and in Python it is called the \n",
      "construction spirit and so whenever you have a class, you must have a construction. \n",
      "Whenever you have a class you must have a construction. Whenever you have a class you \n",
      "must have a construction. And that construction will look like this. Underscore INIT \n",
      "underscore SELF. Is that clear? Raise your hand if you have this. Make sure you are getting \n",
      "this so you cannot take a class and you can pass that to a variable may be called by time, \n",
      "and remember (INDISCERNIBLE) and initially you have two things, initialize zero, zero. And \n",
      "so you will do something like this, this time that we are talking about - and now you can use \n",
      "the name of that class and you can assign it to a variable. So, this variable will be referring \n",
      "to a class time that has two particular variables inside, one called hours and one called \n",
      "minutes. It is usually good to think about this as attributes. Attributes of the class. If that \n",
      "helps.  \n",
      "And so when you do this, the variable now, the value of this variable is a CLAS. Now, you \n",
      "can access now this variable, you can access the attributes, total hours and you can change \n",
      "it. You can set it to nine. And so what that will do is it will update this nine. You can take the \n",
      "second one, upgraded to 45 and so that would be upgraded to 45. You can take that CLAS \n",
      "and assign it to some other variable, time two, for example. So, here you have time one \n",
      "that we were talking about and here you can assign that to another variable. And then that \n",
      "variable will be initialize to whatever it is and now you can open it with time one and time \n",
      "two. As two completely different - as you have been doing with variables all the time, okay.  \n",
      "So, you can change this. This is extremely detailed about this, there's nothing that you will \n",
      "not understand about this year. Now, there is a little bit of a difference now when you want \n",
      "to enhance this construction that we have before, before only we have DEF underscore \n",
      "INIT underscore SELF and now that is the normal way to initialize a CLAS. But, you can \n",
      "actually add parameters in that construction. So, you may have besides SELF, you may have \n",
      "all of the variable names here. And then you can open it with that as well. It is important to \n",
      "understand what this means. This one is associated with itself. This is a attribute of self. \n",
      "This is an attribute of self. And here you can access that attribute by saying SELF.hours and \n",
      "you can assign whatever it is to this and so this is parameter passing by assignment.  \n",
      "And now you can have a class or two parameters, nine and 45 and noticed there are one, \n",
      "two, three parameters and here we had time with two parameters and you have to specify \n",
      "SELF. And now you can operate with this. And now the initialization of the classes by doing \n",
      "this and so the interesting part of a CLAS is what do you do with the elements of that CLAS \n",
      "and so metrics are functions and so for example you can define some function that you \n",
      "would like to take a parameter from the class and you would like to check it this morning or \n",
      "not and so how did he do that? You take that class and you check the parameters and then \n",
      "you return - and it is true. Others parameter is less than 12. So, that means it is morning.  \n",
      "There's nothing deep here, but it is important understand the fact that classes, the way \n",
      "they are defined you can assign them two variables. Now, there are two - and I want to mention something that computer scientists like so you can understand where these \n",
      "things are coming from and there are two very particular data structures and remember \n",
      "you can think of CLAS as data structures, too. They are called stocks and queues. Have you \n",
      "heard of a stack? And have you heard of a qeue? These are two ways to maintain data and \n",
      "so when you have data structures you have to have two things. One is how the data is laid \n",
      "out in the case of a stock and in the case of a queue. And so that is the data laid out. And \n",
      "the most important thing about the data structure is how it operates so you have to follow \n",
      "a protocol.  \n",
      "And a protocol is how new stuff comes into the data structure. And so if there is a stack, \n",
      "the protocol is that this goes this way and that means that your stack is coming here. If it is \n",
      "a queue, this stack is coming here. So, this one goes this way and this one goes this way. \n",
      "Would you like to have a bank that uses this? (POOR AUDIO) of to write several pieces of \n",
      "code. This does it. What is the trick? What is the work being done? (POOR AUDIO) and so \n",
      "we know that we have a method called (NAME) and that pop we would like to \n",
      "(INDISCERNIBLE) and now you have the definition of a CLAS for queue that is routinely \n",
      "using computer science for many things. And you can look at the examples here. You are in \n",
      "a element, the element that your adding is here and you want to have a picture \n",
      "(INDISCERNIBLE) and the element comes and remember this is going this way. You want to \n",
      "take something out and you're going to take it from here. Okay. You can check the \n",
      "example. There is nothing here. The stock, you can now see how similar a stack is to a \n",
      "queue. But, in terms of calling this, it should be very to me I think you know a stack you will \n",
      "define it as a stock and we are going to initialize it. (INDISCERNIBLE) And we assign that \n",
      "something called several items. And so the data for this CLAS is going to be a list. This is \n",
      "what this is saying, this is nothing different than when we have a queue definition in the \n",
      "previous example. And now we are going to have something called push and pop. Well, \n",
      "look at how this looks. This does not look too different, does it? Self items is this list and we \n",
      "are appending something, a new item. The difference here is in this pop. Do you want to \n",
      "pop? Well, this is a list. And we know how to pop something. Now, the difference here and \n",
      "here is that over there we were popping the element at the zero position. Open the \n",
      "element as a zero position. (POOR AUDIO) and you can look at this. Okay, so for example - I \n",

      "something is a line. The most atomic collection of files in a file is a line in that file. And so by \n",
      "saying this we are saying okay, a data file, open the file and the lines are in that file and \n",
      "you're going to read these one at a time. Now you're going to start seeing how we are \n",
      "going to be using everything that we have discussed before. And so over here we are going \n",
      "to be referring to one line in that file and so now that one line is a string of characters, no \n",
      "matter how complicated it is.  \n",
      "And then we would like to do something without line and because there is a string of \n",
      "characters, the methods that we have for the strings can be used. So, a particular method \n",
      "that is used is the split method. And the split is a method that takes a string and is going to \n",
      "take some specifications here and that specification is a parameter and that parameter in \n",
      "this case is saying I want to take that line and I want to look for the separator color and I \n",
      "want to split the line into two pieces. This is one piece and after that separator, that is \n",
      "another piece.  \n",
      "Are you a color, yes you are a color and anything before him and anything after, that is a \n",
      "split. So, after you do that, you have to divide this into two pieces. So, now you are going to \n",
      "assign those two pieces of the line and remember this is shopping like this into two pieces \n",
      "and you assign those to two variables, one called movie and the other one the year. And \n",
      "before that, movie. And after that, the year.  \n",
      "Well, it could be that the data is contingent, but this is what this is doing. This is somehow \n",
      "assuming that what you have before that separator and this is a string and what is the \n",
      "year? It is a number. Okay, this is what this is doing. Splitting and creating these two variables and assigning these two variables the name of the movie and the year from this.  \n",
      "Now, look at the next line. Can anybody tell me what is this? It may be simple, what is this? \n",
      "We have already discussed this method and so movie at this point is a string. It is this thing \n",
      "that came from here. And so we are taking the string and we are stripping what? The blank \n",
      "characters, right? This is what this is doing. So, stripping out the blank characters and now \n",
      "it is assigning that to something and whatever that value is I'm going to assigned in that to \n",
      "what is this? Again, the year is a string and we are stripping that from blank characters and \n",
      "you are assigning this to this. And then you can print whatever you are storing here. So, \n",
      "what this gives you is this - the year and then the name of the movie. Comma, year in the \n",
      "name of the movie and comma, year and name of the movie. Etc. Can you tell me what is \n",
      "this? Yes? And so here you start with some text file and you take each line of the file and \n",
      "broke it into two pieces and for each of the pieces you took out the characters and then \n",
      "you print and that gives you the dictionary. So, this is like taking data and creating a \n",
      "dictionary out of it. You have issues and we give you the picture and so at the beginning \n",
      "you store in a variable called line and so let's say the first line of the file and look at this as \n",
      "some blanket stuff here and there are some blanks here etc. after you have the split \n",
      "divided into two pieces meaning this piece is here and in the second piece is here. And so \n",
      "afterwards there is some stuff there and you would like to clean that somehow and at this \n",
      "point this is the name of the movie with some of the most strange stuff and this is the year \n",
      "which is some strange stuff and you would like to clean this out by removing these strange \n",
      "extra characters that you have. And then that is when you take this string and this string \n",
      "and you strip them from the blank characters and you take the year and you take the name \n",
      "of the movie and you take out the bad characters and now you store that in these value \n",
      "clusters. And what this is doing, this is updating a keyvalue in the dictionary called Oscars. I \n",

      "Oscars and the value is the name of the movie. And so we already covered the dictionaries \n",
      "and so at this point what is it that you need to recall? When we have a dictionary how I \n",
      "have a keyvalue pair to a dictionary and how do you do it? By signing a value to the key and \n",
      "if this is a dictionary, this is what you do. And so this is updating the dictionary and in this \n",

      "Again, this was a string that we will obtain after this and will we apply this same method to \n",
      "it with all of this extra stuff and that is now cool and we take a movie and we strip it from \n",
      "the extra stuff and this is cool and now we make this assignment and this assignment is \n",
      "literally doing the following. It is taking this dictionary that has two entities and remember \n",
      "this is dictionary and it is storing it right here, the year - and this is a reference to the year \n",
      "value and this is a reference to the movie value. This is exactly that. The semantics of this is \n",
      "This here  One more, this is an assignment statement and it is taking something from the right-hand \n",

      "dictionary that is looking at the component year which is this and it is pairing that with the \n",
      "second value and so this is creating a pair, 2014 column 20 years (SP?) this is what the \n",
      "computer is doing and this is what the language is asking the computer to do in the \n",
      "interpreter is doing exactly this. Raise your hand if you got this.  \n",
      "I guess if this is something that you want to take home out of this class is that \n",

      "visual representation in your head for how to do something. And in this particular case, \n",
      "what is this something that we are doing? We are creating a dictionary that is going to have \n",

      "year.  \n",
      "Now, suppose we are not dealing with movies, suppose we are dealing with videos. There \n",
      "is no difference. There is really no difference. They are the same thing. We are creating a \n",
      "dictionary with videos and years. Or maybe you are not dealing with that, maybe you like \n",
      "American football. Well, you can also associate this with the champion. You see, this \n",
      "template are really independent of data and that is what you should take from this class. It \n",
      "is not (INDISCERNIBLE) yes, at some point you have to write this down, but this is more \n",
      "important and so the template here is to create a dictionary that associates years with \n",
      "something and this is an important instruction. And so where do you get the data from? \n",
      "Where did you get the data? From the file. If it is American football, you open the file and \n",

      "I think that that should be enough.  \n",
      "Okay, and after you have that dictionary creation, then you can do many things. For \n",
      "example, you can solve by the year and remember this is a file and the whole point of this, \n",
      "it could be gigantic, after you did this very nice simple piece of Python code, now you have \n",

      "mapping? 1984, the king of whatever continent does the mapping, what is that? That is \n",
      "called an item. In a dictionary. So, a dictionary has three things and one is the list of keys. \n",
      "Another one is the list of values and the other one is the mapping between the two wishes \n",
      "the list of pairs or the list of items. Each item is a pair. Why are we digging into this? Well, \n",

      "referring to? It does not say the Oscar does keys and it does not say Oscar does values, it \n",
      "says Oscar does items and what does this refer to? I just told you what are the items in the \n",
      "dictionary? The mapping, right? This is referring to that mapping. This is saying that we are \n",

      "So, you understand this, then? These are the dictionary items (INDISCERNIBLE) and then \n",
      "you can look at the details, okay. Now we were assuming that we have a file with all of this \n",
      "information and that that file can be read by opening the file, line by line and doing \n",
      "something to each line and creating a dictionary out of it. And yes, this is the reverse. \n",
      "Somebody has to have done that. And so (INDISCERNIBLE) is another operation for file. \n",
      "And yes, you know this. You have heard of this. But when you go through language like \n",
      "Python, you need to know how to write this down. Okay, so for example suppose that you \n",

      "dictionary. This is a dictionary. This is a dictionary and I hope from now on you know what \n",
      "a dictionary is. The way to identify a dictionary is these two brackets and in the middle you \n",
      "have comma and each keyvalue pair is specified in this way with the column. This is a dictionary. This is a dictionary. This is a dictionary. Okay.  \n",
      "Now you want to put that into a file. Now you would like to put that into a file and by that I \n",
      "mean this. (INDISCERNIBLE) Whatever it is called, this pair you would like to put into a file. \n",
      "And so you open a file and give it some name, whatever the purposes and here is the \n",
      "second parameter of this function. This is a function that will open this file and here you \n",
      "specify (INDISCERNIBLE) and the W which is saying that I want to open this file in the right \n",
      "month. That means you're going to put the stuff into that file. This is doing nothing yet, this \n",
      "is just preparing the file to write something into it. Now, we have a dictionary and at the \n",
      "dictionary is going to be something that you can traverse by looking at each keyvalue pair. \n",
      "And so for key values, for this pair in this dictionary, what we are going to do is something. \n",
      "So, open the file and for each pair in this dictionary notice here - the dictionary is grades. \n",
      "We are going to iterate on that dictionary based on the value pairs and at the keyvalue \n",
      "pairs can be accessed by specifying that out of this dictionary I'm going to look at this \n",
      "dictionary by looking at the items i.e. this is item 1 and this is item 2 and this is item 3. \n",
      "okay. So, I'm going to do something to the key values and what is it that we are going to \n",
      "do? Okay, here let me ask you, can anybody tell me how to interpret that? I have one \n",
      "person -  \n",
      ">>STUDENT: (AWAY FROM MIC).  \n",
      ">>PROFESSOR: Very good, I just wish the description instead of the value and calculate, \n",
      "okay? And so what he was explaining to us, what this is doing in this parentheses is taking a \n",
      "key and so this key is that key, whatever that is, we are comparing this with a string that is a \n",
      "column plus this value, and what is not? Well, the value is coming from here. And so in \n",
      "order to (NAME) we need to treat the value as a string and so we are staying STR for the \n",
      "value and then we calculate that with this special character and this special character is the \n",
      "way to specify the end of a line. The end of the line.  \n",
      "This is just an agreement that whenever you see in the file (NAME), okay, this is the end of \n",
      "the line. Remember, you are creating this file by doing this. You are creating a dictionary \n",
      "and you are pushing that into a file in certain formats. This is what this is doing. So, this is \n",
      "creating this string which is the combination of these pieces into something and now it is \n",
      "going to - this is a method that takes this file and remember this is a file variable and apply \n",
      "this method to that file and it is going to write that whole string into a file.  \n",
      "And at the end, you close it. And to close the file, do not leave it open, that creates some \n",
      "problems. Now, to make your life safer, always create an exception. Because, there is \n",
      "nothing new except for the loop (INDISCERNIBLE) and so if there are any issues, because \n",
      "there are always issues. Then you will be notified by the interpreter. And you want to take \n",
      "whatever it happens, at the end of the day, finally and remember this goes through Python, \n",
      "finally I want you to close the file. And over here, if things go wrong, then you may not get \n",
      "to hear and so the file may not be closed. And so by using this, whatever happens, \n",
      "whatever happens, close the file.  \n",
      "And so here there are some more examples and here are some examples parsing the \n",
      "population of the file, that is question three for the quiz and so understand this, this is \n",
      "doing nothing different to what we have done before. Except that there is some special methods. One is a special method called replace that replaces something by something. \n",
      "And so understand that for your quiz. And so (NAME), do you want to show them this map? \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Okay, this is the map of the live performance and we ask these questions in \n",
      "class life and each of these presents a group and so these all represent a group and there \n",

      "those three groups have a big circle inside and out color. The color is green. And so the \n",
      "goal here is that we would like to see not only a big circle inside, but also a colorful one. \n",
