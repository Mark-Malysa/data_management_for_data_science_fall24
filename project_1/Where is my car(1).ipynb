    "In this problem, you are going to implement a game that simulates a driver looking for his/her car in a parking lot. \n",
    "- The parking lot is a 2D grid, and the driver is at the center of the grid. \n",
    "- The driver can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n",
    "- The driver can ring the car to get the distance between the driver and the car. \n",
    "  - Ringing the car will also take one time period.\n",
    "  - The distance is the Manhattan distance between the driver and the car. Namely, the distance is the sum of the absolute differences of the horizontal and vertical coordinates.\n",
    "- The goal of the game is to find the car in 10 time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game will have the following features:\n",
    "- It first generate two integers `car_x`, `car_y` uniformly between `-10` to `10`, which represent the coordinates of the car. positive `x` is right, positive `y` is up.\n",
    "- The driver is at `driver_x = 0` and `driver_y = 0` initially.\n",
    "- It will prompt the user to enter a direction to move or to ring the car.\n",
    "  - If the user enters `move [direction] [Num of Step]`, the driver will move the corresponding number of steps in the specified direction.\n",
    "    - The direction can be `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`.\n",
    "    - The number of steps is optional. \n",
    "      - If provided, it should be a positive integer. \n",
    "      - If not provided, the driver will move one step by default.\n",
    "  - If the user enters `ring`, the driver will ring the car and output the distance between the driver and the car.\n",
    "  - If the user enters other commands, it will output an error message \"Invalid Command\". The game will still count this as a time period.\n",
    "- If the `driver_x` and `driver_y` are the same as `car_x` and `car_y`, it will output a congratulation message \"Congratulation! You have found your car!\".\n",
    "- If after 10 time periods, the driver has not found the car, it will output a message \"You have run out of time. Game Over!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Please complete the code below to implement the game."
